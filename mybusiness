		<p>Greetings.Jaqueline Garcia Lemus, president and founder of Jackie's&reg; Earthy Leaf Tea. I am currently a Cognitive Science major at the University of California, Los Angeles. For the last two years I have been running this tea company along with furthering my studies. I plan on graduating in June 2018 as a Cognitive Science major with a Specialization in Computing.
		</p>
		<p>During the past years as an undergraduate student,tea has always been a fantastic remedy for me in staying energized, relaxed, and simply happy. Therefore, I decided to start this company for others to experience the greatness of drinking tea. I remember going to the store to buy tea and experiencing choice overload by the wide selection of teas and not knowing which tea would give what effect. Therefore, I decided to focus on the simplicity of tea and just provide a limited selection for customers along with explanations as to what each type of tea helps the customer with. I am a strong believer in natural remedies and I belive tea is great for a multitude of needs. I hope you will all enjoy the wonders of tea as much as I do!
